# Ada Script Agents Framework

## 1. Project Overview
**Ada Script** is a framework for building and managing autonomous agents that perform specialized tasks in software analysis, emulation, and reverse engineering. The system enables the creation of collaborative agent networks that can analyze executable files, emulate runtime behavior, and generate comprehensive reports.

## 2. Purpose and Features
The primary purpose of this agent framework is to automate complex reverse engineering and analysis workflows. Key features include:

- **Modular agent architecture** - Easily extendable with new capabilities
- **Distributed task processing** - Agents can work in parallel on complex tasks
- **Cross-platform support** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Emulation capabilities** - Safe execution of untrusted binaries
- **Analysis pipelines** - Chain multiple agents for complex workflows

## 3. Architecture Overview
The system follows a microservices architecture with these core components:

```mermaid

    A[Client] --> B[Orchestrator]
    B --> C[Analyzer Agent]
    B --> D[Emulator Agent]
    B --> E[Parser Agent]
    C --> F[Database]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

- **Orchestrator**: Manages agent coordination and task distribution
- **Analyzer Agent**: Performs static analysis of executable files
- **Emulator Agent**: Executes binaries in a controlled environment
- **Parser Agent**: Processes and structures analysis results
- **Database**: Stores analysis results and agent states

## 4. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for emulation environment)

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ada-script.git
cd ada-script

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Docker for emulation
docker pull ada-script/emulator-base
```

### Running the System
```bash
# Start the orchestrator
python orchestrator.py

# Start an agent
python agent.py --type analyzer
```

## 5. Example Usage

### Basic Analysis
```python
from ada_client import OrchestratorClient

client = OrchestratorClient("localhost:5000")
task_id = client.submit_task(
    target="egame.exe",
    agents=["analyzer", "emulator"]
)

results = client.get_results(task_id)
print(results)
```

### Sample Output
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": "PE32 executable for MS Windows",
  "imports": ["kernel32.dll", "user32.dll"],
  "emulation_results": {
    "api_calls": ["CreateFileA", "ReadFile"],
    "memory_operations": 142
  },
  "risk_score": 0.24
}
```

## 6. Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
export ADA_DB_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/ada_db
export ADA_EMULATION_MEMORY=1024
```

### Agent Configuration (config.yaml)
```yaml
agents:
  analyzer:
    timeout: 300
    max_depth: 5
  emulator:
    memory_limit: 512MB
    sandbox: docker
```

## 7. Limitations and Known Issues
- Limited support for packed executables
- Emulation of network operations is currently disabled
- Large binaries (>100MB) may cause performance issues
- ARM architecture emulation is experimental

## 8. Roadmap and Next Steps
- [ ] Add support for Mach-O and ELF binaries
- [ ] Implement distributed agent networking
- [ ] Develop GUI dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Add machine learning-based threat detection
- [ ] Create plugin system for custom analyzers
